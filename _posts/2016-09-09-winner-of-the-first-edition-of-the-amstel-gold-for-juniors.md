# Ide Schelling wins inaugural Amstel Gold Junior Classic. Not bad for a \#FatBoy ...but I'm talking wheels!

\#SpinOnThese and Win On These ...thanks to Ide Schelling for winning one of my favourite classic races. Awesome ride dude!

If you're thinking of slotting a pair of DM8s in your own bike, then you'd better get ready to fly like Ide. But please remember to let us know what happens - I'd love to hear about your race wins, near misses, or next epic rideout.
