# Ide Schelling's stellar season!

# Wins in Amstel Gold, GP Ruëbliland & 7th at the Worlds ...this is the story of Ide's incredible ride on some wheels I made him

# The Bike Maker's Story

I'm Drew, the old guy behind Spin Industries, and the maker of the wheels Ide Schelling rode throughout the 2016 road season.

I first got to know Ide after receiving a very polite message from him via instagram, sometime back in late 2015\. His insta-message said something like Hey Spin, those wheels you make look fast! I need more fast, so can you make some for me?

Now, I get asked for sponsorship by a lot of young bike racers, and I've been lucky enough to make wheels for some really great youngsters who also happen to be serial big race winners, young guys like Lewis and Ben Askey.

Naturally, and just as you'd expect, everyone who asks me for sponsorship tells me what a great rider they are, or more usually how much better they're going to be once they get some free wheels to race on! But Ide, who was 17 at that time, lives in Holland and whom I'd never met came across as a very different kind of bike racer, and he passed my initial tests of character with great speed, enthusiasm and flying colours.

So I was ready and happy to make him some nice 'n' fast Fat Boys, on which I hoped at the very least I'd occasionally get to see him enjoying via his instagram feed.

But to be honest, and having been here with racers I've sponsored many times before - racers both young and old - I really didn't expect to hear too much from him ever again.

But as soon as Ide received those wheels I'd made him, I got a nice email back thanking me, giving me his first impressions, and he was also thoughtful enough to post this photo on his instagram immediately.
![And he hasn't even ridden them yet ...But boy, Ide certainly put them to good use as the 2016 season progressed](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9530d1a3-3393-41b9-b918-78698b418405.jpg)

OK. Thanks Ide - that's a nice start I thought to myself.

Ide had previously told me he was racing for the Dutch national junior team and also his local Monkey Town road club team. Great I thought - Dutch juniors must be fairly good bike riders, but whether or not this was true or not, I had no real idea. And still, I didn't expect to hear too much more from him once he'd emailed me again to say he'd ridden his wheels and liked them - not least as school, training and racing already takes up a huge chunk of time, and even more energy.

But Ide kept me up to speed with regular emails throughout the early season, despite not having too much exciting news or success to share with me. Honestly, this is all too rare for small equipment makers like myself. It's kind of understandable I guess - every young racer wants big name equipment sponsors, and often it feels like when they "only" land a deal with a smaller brand, they almost feel like they've been short changed!

So that's what I'm mostly used to - not always, with some very notable exceptions, just mostly. Anyway, Ide Schelling, at the age of 17, changed that for me, and did so with a level of professionalism, good humour and humility throughout that is quite rare. Aspiring young racers hoping to attract sponsors and keep them should take note!

So, Ide kept in touch even when there wasn't much to shout about, but as spring turned into summer, his season got busy and then went BANG! 

I kept up with the mounting string of successes that Ide was claiming mostly through his instagram feed. The race wins just kept getting bigger and bigger in terms of prestige and quality. It was an exhilarating ride for me just watching from a distance!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a4553e30-43c4-43ed-bb83-0861c30a1977.jpg)
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4b9d32dd-9ffd-4813-854e-eb55260c855d.png)

The regular emails from Ide got a little less regular, which is totally understandable with all this action. And yet, he still found time to tell me all the exciting and important stuff. He even remembered to ask how things were with me. 

Here's an example:

> Aug 27
> Hi Drew!
> It's been a while since I send you an e-mail so I thought lets make one!
> Things are going good over here, after my exams in May there was a looooong holiday with many races. I went on a holiday with my parents to France and after that I stayed at a friends house in Girona for a while where I could train good and get my shape back after school. At the end of the holiday I had a Nationscup in Luxemburg and since then things are going good!! Well, you've seen all my results on social media so I won't have to tell you what's been up haha! 
> Last week we had a trainings week with the Dutch selection where I learned a lot and heard that I am going to the Europian Championships!!!! Very happy to be selected for that race! Also some continental teams saw my results in all the races and 3 teams offered me a place!! So awesome :):) my choice is going out to SEG racing acedemy. That's a team who will help me develup myself as a rider ...
> On tuesday my new college begins and I am really excited about it, I will be present on the first day but on wednesday I am already leaving to Swiss for another race (also with the Dutch National team). So they will see me one day at school and I am already leaving haha, but that will be okay! 
> How is business over there and thing are going well?
> Greetzz Ide
> 

During this period, Ide won the Valkenburg Klim Classic from a strong and classy field - a race now widely known as the Junior Amstel Gold, after the iconic Dutch hard man's one day race over the same tough climbs.

He also swept up Stage 1 of Swiss GP Ruëbliland from an international field comprising the world's top junior bike racing talent - sprinting for the win after more than 100km in the decisive three-up break.

![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b80491a3-8878-4fee-a4fe-1d7e8fddb7c5.jpg)

Wow! Naturally, I started wondering to myself if things could possibly get any better for this young bike racer that I'd simply met out of the blue?

Then I got another email:

> Sep 20
> Hello Drew,
> Sorry for the late reply, I thought that I had replied already, but that was only in my head... :|
> Some more big news, yesterday I got to hear that I am riding the world championships!!!!! It is in Doha, Qatar. A really cool city, google it up ;). I was so happy with the news, it's gonna be one hell of a jerney !
> I am curious for your plans for next year!
> Cheers Ide
> 

Cool! Well, we decided together that we'd celebrate his first World Road Race Championships, by having Ide ride all the hard miles extremely fast, whilst I got the short straw and would make him some special wheels.

In fact I sent him three wheels to choose from: my own favourites, the DM858s - in fact I whipped my own pair off my very own bike and sent them out to Ide. And also I made him a deeper rear wheel in the form of a custom DMX990\. Ide had already researched the parcours and told me it was pan flat so thought it would be cool to have a super deep rear slotted in the back of his trusty Storck bike.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5ccc017f-2335-4448-89b7-dea843267e96.jpg)
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9694be49-3ea6-43b5-aa1d-cec63796a354.jpg)
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bd8fb97f-e74b-44b1-a1e4-48fe02cd106d.jpg)

In the end Ide chose to race with the 58 up front and the 90 rear. And boy, did he put these \#FatBoys to good use, lighting up the race from the very first corners, always pushing up the pace and making all the moves throughout those early kms. 

As the pace started to take its toll and the strong men made their presence felt, Ide was always right there, and without hesitation got into all of the decisive breaks as the race wore on and the field whittled down. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6bae0e38-8766-4476-a8ba-b47827092eb9.jpg)

To my old racer's brain, and with no team mates to call on for most of the race, Ide had no choice but to work too hard throughout and coming home 7th across the finish line was most probably a very insufficient reward for all his hard work and attacking style.

It was however a truly exhilarating day spent glued to the computer screen in my shed, watching the race live on the eurosport player. Thanks eurosport, and thanks Ide!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/99ba9a1e-4637-438b-a067-496a4191210a.jpg)

Just a day or so later another email arrived from Ide:

> Oct 15
> Hello Drew, Back from Doha!
> It was such an awesome trip and even a cooler race, I enjoyed every minute of it!
> Have you seen the live coverage of the race? 
> Your wheels are luckily still okay after 2 flights and a race with many many crashes, today I put your cassette and tyres back on. They are almost ready to ship them back to you :)
> Cheers Ide
> P.S.
> Everybody liked the wheels so much! They looked amazing in my bike, even some pro's said: whow nice wheels, you will probably win on these :p
> 

I was really intrigued to know why Ide had chosen the super deep but much heavier 990 rear wheel over the lighter 858, which in my opinion at least should be much better suited to road race conditions, and especially with all the constant accelerations and corners found on the Doha circuit. So I asked, and almost instantly got the reply back:

> I liked the deeper wheels a lot, maybe you will find the reasons why a bit stupid which I understand as you are a wheel maker and a precisionist. (don't know if that's a word in England)
> But I liked the dm858's riding style super much, and to be honest I didn't felt a world of difference between the riding style between the 960 back wheel or the 858 backwheel. Maybe that's because I am not experienced enough in feeling small differences. But what I did liked about the 960 backwheel is the sound and the feeling when going fast. The sound when you shift on the 960 wheel just gives me a boost, or when your going 45km p/h and you stand on the pedals it just goes whoosh whoosh whoosh. And that is why I chose for the 960 backwheel, it gave me an extra special feeling and a extra boost + it looked just soo amazing!
> 

So there you go! All the analysis, calculations, tests and back of envelope design changes I work through are nothing compared to something that just feels, looks and sounds right! 

But I totally understand that, as so much of human performance is entirely outside the scope of wind tunnels, data and so on. Confidence in yourself, and in your equipment is often what it's all about.

It was an awesome experience working with Ide Schelling in 2016, and I wish him the very best of luck for his future, starting right now with the incredible outfit that is the SEG Racing Academy. Sadly for me, with big money equipment sponsors backing SEG, Ide will no longer ride and race my wheels.

But the story for me is not completely over. As Ide moves on with his career, he has very kindly introduced new racers to me and to the wheels I make. Watch this space to see the exciting developments I'm working on for 2017 with Rutger Overstegen and his Girona based Rocacorba Racing squad.

And finally, when Ide sent back my own DM858s shortly after the worlds, he also packed in a nice surprise for me: a complete set of Dutch National Team kit, the actual kit issued to him for the Worlds. It's a wonderful souvenir of our journey together.

Sadly, I look terrible in bright orange lycra. And Ide's size of race kit (super extra skinny) is a better fit on my kids than on me! But it certainly looks cool on display in my bike shed.

Thanks so much for letting me in on this ride Ide!

# The Bike Racer's Story

## The Big Interview with certified \#Fast \#FatBoy Ide Schelling
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a03e63bc-df4c-4488-be20-202974405d49.png)

**Hey Ide, welcome back home from the Worlds. You rode an awesome race from start to finish and I really must apologise to all my customers who waited an extra day or two for their new wheels as I admit that I didn't get a lot of work done that day. **

**The way you rode, I'm guessing this was not your first World Championships, right?**

Yep this was my first world championships!

**So, how did riding the Worlds Road Race compare to riding a beer bike up the Cauberg?**

Haha, good one. They where both awesome experiences but the World Road Race was a bit more special. It is always nice to come out for your country, and then in this race!?!

The beer bike was pretty heavy too but I suffered more at the Worlds :).
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/51852009-2c73-4311-8f37-9e0658afae36.jpg)

**How did you cope with the heat in Doha? We saw a lot of riders collapsing at the side of the road with exhaustion and exposure, not looking too good at all.**

Yeah, there were a lot of riders who couldn't take the heat. What we did with the Netherlands is train in a heat room, we did 2hr trainings in 33 degrees. Lots of sweat and lots of pain, but finally it worked out pretty well as you can see nobody of the Netherlands passed out in the TT or road race. Woman junior also won the title in the TT! I think for the road race everybody where only complaining and whining over the conditions, in the end it was just as any other hot race. We could take drinks every 7k so I didn't saw the problem... The Belgiums had another opinion, freaking whiners :p.

For the TT I can see the problem as you are giving all you got and you got a hot helmet on your head.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92cbd0c8-4694-48e8-9657-9094a190e7d8.jpg)

**We also saw a lot of punctures in the Junior Men's race. I guess there were a lot of carbon rims over heating and tyres popping as a result. Happily you managed to avoid any of this, so what's your secret?**  
I didn't even know there were so many flats, when I watched back the race myself I saw the amount of flats. I don't know why it was. My secret... fresh tyres!

**How did it feel to ride so strongly all race? **

My goal was to get in as many breaks as possible because I know that in a mass sprint my chances for victory are nill. So from the beginning of the race I started to jump on everything and also attack myself to get in a early break-away. It costed me some energy but I just needed to get in that one break!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1c827919-dd3a-41b1-a6bd-d64d894ff4f6.jpg)

After a while we got away with 5 and soon it started to grow till 22 riders, it wasn't a early breakaway anymore but still a good one! I did my turns and felt myself go down and down. I didn't had the energy in the end to attack because I felt that cramp was upcoming after every corner. I decided to sprint for the best place available.

In the end that turned out to be a 2nd place. From my group I sprinted to a 6th place and got 7th in total. A result I didn't see coming because this parcours is definitely not one which I prefer (total flat).

So with a top-10 place and an awesome race I could be nothing more than happy ;).

**What's been the biggest result of your year?**

This year I had multiple big wins, but the one which is gonna stay with me the best is GP Ruëbilland, 1st stage. In the break for over 100k and sprinted to victory while I thought I wouldn't make it. That made it extra special. Also the field was unbelievable big and international!

**And your proudest achievement - apart from pushing the beer bike, obviously?**

That would also be my proudest! But the overall win in Ronde des Vallees is also a special one. Because I own that one from my team too and we haven't had such great team work before that race and also not after.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/730812f3-702e-40a9-bb5d-490233bb56d6.jpg)

**What was it like for you to win the Junior Amstel Gold race - Holland's one and only Spring Classic race, and also one my own favourites? Oh, and do you get a lifetime supply of free beer?**

Amstel Gold was also a special one, a race which I saw at the beginning of the year on the calender and thought: WOW awesome race! So that made it extra cool to win there. About the name, it is actually called different but because of all the famous hills in it everybody started to call it the amstel gold for juniors. So did I, as it sounds cooler too :) (don't tell anybody haha)

![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/400da889-1186-4340-88c0-15219be4ce95.jpg)

**Let's go back. When did you start riding a bike and how soon did you decide to go racing?**  
  
I'm 18 now, and I'll be 19 in February 2017\. When I started cycling 6 years back I started on a club called The Spartaan. It was a very youth friendly club and it was perfect for starting. The first few years I wasn't to good and most of the races I just finished in the peloton, but I did showed my pugnacity already. It was just a bit less stunning. After my niveau was getting better I moved to another club because the Spartaan was too youth focussed and not focussed on getting results, which was good for the beginning.  

**So, were you always this fast? **

When I got older I started to ride better and better, since the age of 15 there has been a rising line. Not only in getting better but also getting better and better compared to the opponents, when I became junior I started to win much but only in small races and criteriums. Not any like this year where I was winning UCI races and finishing on podiums in nationscups!

**How do you manage to fit all of your cycling in with school, home life and everything else you need to do? What do your family think about your bike racing?**

My parents like it that I race, but luckily they are not the kind of parent who is coming with me every race and sit on my lip. I am pretty independent and I like that. Furthermore my family is a good support, sometimes I watch how other riders are getting supported by their whole family and then mine is not even close. But I like it how the way it is!

**Are you good at any other sports?**

Many sports I am good at, only 1 sport I always did not liked and sucked at is soccer...

**How about music?**

I like a various kind of music, the real Pop songs I am not really interested in. I am more a guy of some old rock music! Tenacious D is my favorite band :)

**Who's your favourite bike rider of all time? And why?**

A favourite bike rider I don't really have. Also I am not that interested in the past about cycling. Bike riders who stand out I like, and not bike riders who stand out because of their skills. A guy as Daniel Oss is one of my favourites, that's also because he shows his life isn't only about cycling but also does other things and still is a very good pro cyclist. 

And then of course, Peter Sagan. But hey, who isn't a fan of him?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e2ecd2eb-6de9-41c2-8e2a-2fd8880f978f.jpg)

**At the Worlds, did you get to hang out with any of the big name pros? And did they have any advice for you?**

We did a training with the pro's, I was just next to Niki Terpstra when he gave some extra gas to give some tension on his legs. It was full gas for me! 

Also I was looking for a pro woman rider, Annemiek van Vleuten so I could borrow her Oakley glasses. I remembered her room number incorrect and ended up knocking on Tom Dumoulins door :P ...that was fun!

In the end I didn't felt comfortable with the oakley and sticked to my good old fashion sunnies!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bed728db-b273-42d2-a589-19b739fe4cc8.jpg)

**So what are you going to do in the off-season?**

In the off-season it is gonna be a bit of everything, I am not doing major races but just doing stuff that keeps it fun. I like to MTB or do some rides on the beach next to my roadbike. Searching for a bit of competition now and then on the beach bike or mountainbike.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d3ccd8e0-ac29-43be-8696-d002c823c517.png)

**Beach racing or Cyclo Cross?**

Beach racing! It is such an awesome feeling when you are at the head of the peloton at the begining of the race, sometimes you start with 1000 people so there are 999 people in your wheel!

**How did you hear about the wheels I make? And what made you choose to race little known wheels from England instead of really famous Dutch wheels?**

I was scrolling through instagram and that's where I found your wheels. After a look on your website I knew I had to get yours!

**So, with all the success you've earned in 2016, you've joined SEG Racing for the 2017 season. Can you tell those of us less familiar with the Dutch race scene who SEG are, and what makes them such a special outfit for a young racer to join?**

SEG racing academy is a continental road cycling team based in The Netherlands, but has a very international group of riders.

What makes SEG special of other lead-up teams as U23 BMC, U23 Lotto Soudal, U23 Giant Alpecin etc. is that when you're in a lead-up team like that, you gotta fight for the 2 or 3 spots left in the worldtour team. 

SEG is in that case different, they are also a management bureau where also pro riders are in. And via contacts from the management bureau SEG is getting riders in teams all over the world. Every year they deliver 3 or 4 riders to pro-continental or worldtour teams! This is gonna be the third year for SEG racing academy.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c4174db5-0a18-468f-b9c4-52e5b791bed1.jpg)

**So what are you most looking forward to in this next stage in your cycling journey? **

Next year is going to be a year to learn a lot, racing is gonna be different and harder. I don't have any goals yet.

**Ide, how far do you think you can take your road racing? What is it that you most want to achieve?**

I hope to be in the worldtour peloton one day and live a happy life. For me a happy life doesn't mean win big races, if I can be in the pro peloton and make a good living out of it by working for others and enjoying it, that would be more than fine to me!

**I've been lucky enough to make wheels for quite a few truly great young racers these last few years and it really has been a privilege for me to see how they manage their success but also deal with the setbacks. So is there one particular piece of advice you can offer all those racers out there, the young guys and girls, and also the not so young racers too - something that you believe has helped you become the racer you are today?**

Don't take things too seriously - that is the first thing that came in to my mind. Keep it fun when your not a pro rider yet.

But make sure you do your training hours and always seek for good company as it makes training so much more fun.

Try to be different in your own way. That's what I did and hopefully will be doing the following years.

**Thanks so much for your time Ide. And for riding all those hard miles on my wheels! It's been quite some journey that we rode this year, and an honour for me to have worked with you. I'll be watching your career unfold, and no matter where it takes you, I hope that you'll always continue to enjoy the ride.**

Thank you Drew - I really appreciate your work and your wheels. Spin wheels will always be in my mind! 

And I wish you the best of luck with your next big project with Rutger, I am sure it will be a blast! Maybe one day I am gonna be a rider of Rutgers Rocacorba team :)
