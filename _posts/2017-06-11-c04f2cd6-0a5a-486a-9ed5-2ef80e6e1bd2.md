# F-Fast!

## This is what the 2017 London Nocturne looked like... \#raphanocturne

On Saturday Minime & me got up extra early, climbed into the wagon and made our way to the Big Smoke, armed with a full lock 'n' load of custom \#FatBoys ready to rumble.

We met up with a host of friends who'd journeyed from near and far, old and new. We drank a lot of coffee and maybe even a ginger beer or two.

We watched in awe as the man himself, [Alec Briggs][0] wheelied across the line to take the men's fixed crit just ahead of Cinelli Chrome's Ignazio Moser, IRD's [Alessandro Mariani][1], R3VO Racing's [William Lewis][2] and a whole lotta fast and strong dudes. Fixed Pott's super stylin' [Eike Haumann][3] got caught by an early crash but rode home fast & solo anyway, as the re-start didn't want to wait.

The women's fixed crit was also marred by crashes and re-started with just 5 laps remaining. Jasmine Dotti took the win with an impressive sprint ahead of a super strong field over some crazy last laps, just pipping [Jo Smith][4], [Hayley Edwards][5] and [Juliet Elliott][6] to the flag.

My mate [Claudio di Santo][7] of [Cykeln Divisione Corse][8] flew over from Firenze with his bronzed & be-muscled band of brothers to put on a great show right from the gun in the Men's Elite road race.

In short, we had a two-wheeled blast. Congratulations to Rapha for staging such a wonderful festival of speed, bikes, beer and friends, all right in the heart of the City.

Click the arrow link button below for more of the action captured by my phone, or keep scrolling on down the page for lots more Nocturne awesomeness, with vlogs from [Juliet Elliott][9] & [Francis Cade][10] further down, but kicking off right below with photos from [Sam Dunn][11].

Spin on Copenhagen!
