> I'm loving every minute of riding them Drew! I was out yesterday doing some big climbs and they're just as responsive and comfy climbing as they are descending or cruising! Proper top notch wheels! 
> What I'm really surprised about is the difference in comfort from the last time I had \[famous name\] deep section carbon wheels and they always felt really hard and never really settled on them!
> I'm blown away by their quality - every ride is a reminder of how nice they are. 

## ... always more fun on wheels like these!

## Thanks for riding the DM8 \#FatBoys Tim!
