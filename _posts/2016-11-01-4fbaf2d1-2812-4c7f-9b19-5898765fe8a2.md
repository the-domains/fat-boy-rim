That's my bike up there and those DM8s slotted in are my very own pair. They're actually my \#1 wheel of choice for every ride - any ride, any weather, any time and anywhere. As I'm the old geezer who makes 'em, you might expect that I'm not short on nice pairs of wheels to pick and choose from, and you'd be right. But the thing is, once you've ridden the DM858s, they're really hard to _not _ride.

Paired up with these sweet Vittoria Corsa Competizione open clinchers and barely 60psi of air inside, they make every ride come alive with lightning response, effortless speed and incredible levels of grip - even on wet and slippery winter roads. Yet it always feels like I'm floating along inside a very fast Rolls Royce - the comfort that the super fat DM8 rim profile delivers is truly game changing. It's only by having to pedal every once in a while that I'm still reminded I'm definitely out on my bike!

It's not just the significant aero performance and seemingly effortless speed these DM8s deliver. It's not even the driving, inspiring soundtrack they generate as you roll along, making them so much fun to ride. No - the really cool thing about the 58s is that there's barely any price to pay in extra weight for going this deep. You see, I make these wheels at around 1540 - 1560 grams a pair. That's only 40- 60g more per pair than the lightest DM8s in my range: the much shallower, significantly less aero, 38mm deep DM838s.

If you're a super light, whippet thin rider, then maybe you might just prefer the 38s. But for me slotting these 58s in my bike - and keeping them there, no matter what - is a simple no brainer. They're also the wheel of choice for Girona Spain based pro continental outfit [Rocacorba Racing][0] as well as the decidedly cool fixed crit racing [Thundercats of North London][1]

By the way, if that bike takes your fancy, I invite you to head over to http://speedmetal.bike/ where you can find out about the entirely bespoke custom titanium frames we make.
