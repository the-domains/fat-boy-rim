I was scrolling through instagram one day and came across this very dramatic photo of someone who was obviously one of my customers. But I wasn't too sure who this International Man of Mystery could be.

Out of the illustrious band of riders and racers who \#SpinOnThese across the globe, which one had perfected such an awesomely aerodynamic moustache? I had an idea, so fired off an email to my old pal James Buchanen in Dubai, and soon got this reply.

> Hi Drew -- It is indeed me! Here is the picture attached. I have a couple of other pictures from Weihai Long Course ITU, which I raced as an elite...and frankly I got spanked.
> 

> Well, not that badly spanked, I didn't come last. But I cant believe how fast they can swim. So I was a bit ashamed about that at the time, but having now licked my wounds and got back into training well, I am actually fine with it and I can say that I learnt a huge amount on where my weakness lie. Which probably deserves a short report. I will send some photos after this mail.

## So here it is, James' report on his 2016 Weihai ITU Elite Long Course

Weihai ITU Elite Long course. 18th place (almost last, but not quite). Firstly, for anyone who gets the chance to race or even visit China -- take it! An amazing place filled with people who will give time and energy to help you enjoy your stay even if the language barrier makes it hard for them.

Weihai is the home of triathlon in China (an ITU World Series event will take place this year) and has been hosting triathlon for over 10 years. I decided, based on the times of previous years, that although it was a swim heavy format (3km swim, 80km bike and 20km run), the times of the swim and run were well within my wheelhouse and I could compete. That turned out to be true, but I under estimated the bike course had 2000m plus of climbing, one single climb of 2km averaging 11% and switchback descents where you topped 90km. So you need good wheels. I had great wheels. But you also need to be able to swim.

> So you need good wheels. I had great wheels. But you also need to be able to swim.

At this point I should probably point out that I have only been swimming for 1 year, and never swam more than 1.9km without a wetsuit (in fact never swam more than that ever).

So it was a long and lonely swim back to the last bike in transition with a sympathy clap from a supportive crowd....but anything can happen in long course racing and over time I pulled things back and with a sensible pacing strategy worked my way back up the field past other (better) athletes who just didn't respect the course or conditions.

Arnold Schwarzenegger said he always preferred workouts where he failed, because he learnt more and knew how much closer he needed to be to his goal. So I take my beating. I learn my lessons and I fight another day. This time in Malaysia for Ironman Malaysia.
