Hello Drew   
Pinging over a hello as long time no speak. Just wanted to catch up. Hope business is good and Spin wheels are flying out.

This morning 7am start just did Exminster to Barnstaple in 2 hour 9 mins. Average speed 75% quartile as per power meter data 21.9 mph ~ a 44 miler on rolling roads with the 58mm shod on my Cervelo R5\.

As always, utterly brilliant wheels. Flawless. I cannot hold candle to your red hook crit guys but these wheels, man, they make me feel brilliant and are just on another level. Bloody brilliant.

Hope this email finds you well !!!

## Thanks for riding Pete!
