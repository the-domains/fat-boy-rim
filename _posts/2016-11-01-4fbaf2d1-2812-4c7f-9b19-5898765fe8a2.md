That's my bike up there and the DM8s I have slotted in are my very own \#1 wheels of choice - any ride, any weather, any time and anywhere. As I'm the bloke who makes 'em, you might not be surprised to know that I've got plenty of nice wheels back in the shed to pick and choose from. But the thing is, once you've ridden them, the DM858s are really hard to _not _ride.

Paired up with these sweet Vittoria Corsa Competizione open clinchers and barely 60psi of air inside, they make every ride come alive with lightning response, effortless speed and incredible levels of grip - even on wet and slippery winter roads. Yet it always feels like I'm floating along in a very fast Rolls Royce - the comfort that the super fat DM8 rim profile delivers is truly game changing. It's only by having to pedal every once in a while that I'm still reminded I'm definitely out on my bike!

It's not just their significant aero performance, not even the driving soundtrack these wheels generate as you roll effortlessly along that makes them so, so much fun to ride. No - the really cool thing about the 58s is there's barely any weight penalty to pay for going this deep. On average, I make these wheels at 1540 - 1560 grams a pair. That's between 40- 60g more per pair than the lightest DM8s in my range, the much shallower, significantly less aero 38mm deep DM838s.

So for me, slotting these 58s in my bike - and keeping them there, no matter what time of year or type of terrain I'm riding - is a no brainer. They're also the wheel of choice for Girona Spain based pro continental outfit [Rocacorba Racing][0] as well as the decidedly cool fixed crit racing [Thundercats of North London][1]
