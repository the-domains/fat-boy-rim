An 08.07 start in the Étape du Tour 2017 meant getting up at 4.00am and leaving our hotel in Bardonecchia, Italy by 5.00am.

The start in Briançon was going to be hectic with 16,000 riders turning up to start between 07.00 and 09.00, so we decided to leave our cars about 15k out of Briançon, then ride down to the start. We would have to ride back up a long steep hill to get back out of town to our cars, plus the 20k downhill from the Col de l'Izoard to Briançon meant the day was 230k of riding.

What a super event the Étape du Tour is. The organisation and facilities for so many riders is incredible, and riding on the closed roads is just heaven.

The downhill descents of the Col de Vars and Col de l'Izoard, not to mention the lesser Côte des Demoiselles Coiffées, was sheer delight with no cars, but it meant avoiding some slower riders and some who just don't look around.

> My Spin DM8 Fatboys are such a great ride. 

Apart from being comfortable, they ride smoothly, absorb any bumps, and glide at speed. With the riding I do its important I have wheels that can corner well too, which these do. They also look good which is an integral part of riding a bike.

What I really like though, as someone living in the Alps in France, is that the braking surface compound is perfect for long descents. I mean the rims do not overheat with braking, and I can descend with comfort and surety, which is so important. I have experienced other carbon wheel brands where this has not been the case and the rims have disfigured.

After about ten hours including a few stops at feeding stations and a Mavic service area (my front mech needed adjusting) I made the finish at the top of the Izoard, where a beer bar was packed with riders. Thankfully no more juices and electrolytes which can become awful after time.

A fantastic quick 20k descent to Briançon then a reunion with two friends who were taking part, Jun from Singapore, and John my old North London CC mate from the 60's. Some pasta and a bit of waiting, then the 15k ride uphill to the car, we eventually got back to Bardonecchia at about 10.00pm.

A fantastic weekend as we had arrived on the Friday, rode a short ride on the Saturday in Italy, and drove home on the Monday.

> Wheels make the difference to a ride, and I am so glad Drew was able to help me choose wheels for my needs.
