# Koppenbergs on the Koppenberg

![Hup! Hup! Hup!  It's only the bleedin' Koppenberg! ](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2c57e841227276b2cbabfd9eb419c260e43cdcd0.jpg)

Le Domestique Tours offer fully supported, one-day and longer trips out from the UK to cycle sport's most famous, iconic and very toughest playgrounds to be found sur le continent. The one-day Tours of Flanders tours are amongst the most popular during the long winter and spring months, giving everyone the chance to \#ridelikeaflandrien just like some of my very own cycling heroes.

So when it came to selecting wheels that could handle the often wet and mud-slicked cobbles during the peak Spring Classic season, week-long mid-summer tours of the alps, as well as regular weeknight crit racing, I was very pleased when Rob, Le Domestique's rider and tour guide in chief asked me if I thought that my carbon wheels would be tough enough, and if so, which would be the best suited.

With this broad range of riding and conditions in mind, there was really only one choice. The best all-rounder in the DM8 line-up: The Rouleur DM845\.
![It may not look much in this serene image. But try riding de Koppenberg on a nice sunny day and you'll know what a brute of a climb it is. Ride mid-winter and in the wet and you'll know if you're as good as you think! Every twist and turn, cobble and rut will be seared in your memory forever! ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ea93a8b5-5f99-4479-ba55-a844dd5e8ede.jpg)

Not only fast on the ups and downs, and super grippy on the super slippy, the DM8 rims are built as tough as nails and are more than capable of being slammed into cobble edges and down in the ruts time and again. 

Rob was sceptical, so back in February I lent him my very own pair and he duly slotted them in his favourite Ciocc and rode them throughout all of his Spring Flandrien Tours. Naturally Rob managed to shred the brand new Open Paves I'd shod them with, but happily couldn't destroy my wheels.

Rob purchased his very own pair soon after, and sadly went on to crash his beloved Ciocc beyond repair during a circuit race. Happily both Rob and his DM8s survived fully intact and continue to roll together in a perpetual state of two-wheeled bliss.

Back at my all time favourite Flandrien 'berg, this local fella stopped Rob on the way up one time in order to take a closer look. Hang on a mo' ... that looks a lot like the Lion of Flanders himself, Mr. Johan Musseeuw. Blimey - it is!
![Probably the single most epic bike race I ever witnessed was thanks to this man's 50km solo attack in true hardman style through the mud & slick pave to victory in Roubaix. So for me it doesn't get much better than when the Lion of Flanders himself @johanmuseeuw gets off his bike to check out the Fat Boy Rims I made for Rob of one day tour specialists @ledomtours. Thanks for stopping Johan! And thanks for riding Rob! #Cycling #cyclinghistory #flanders #flandersclassic #ridelikeaflandrien #johanmuseeuw #Koppenberg #cobbles #bike #springclassic #spinonthese](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e44bda246d857976bc6908ea31fa4f89f499fdb.jpg)

For a long time fan of the man as I surely am, it's pretty awesome for me to see the wheels I make and Johan in the very same shot. 

All I need to do now is get him to ride 'em! Sadly for me, I think he's signed up to Spesh these days, but I'm happy to wait it out.
