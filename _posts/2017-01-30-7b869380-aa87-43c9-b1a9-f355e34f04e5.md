> Hey Drew :)
> How are you? long time no talk so thought would fill you in on the happenings. As you saw im back in Aus now and now back into training. Had my first race of the year today a local criterium, happy to say I took the win ;)
> Loving all the wheels youre putting out and mostly mine! ...they are so awesome :) Especially today first time racing on them, they grip like crazy I was getting a bike length on every corner.
> Talk soon
