> Hi Drew
> As you can probably tell from the title I am writing this email full of confidence as I have won my first half iron distance triathlon. It was a local event in Singapore, which although a little trek from Dubai, had 300 people in the race and represented the climate conditions I was looking for to make sure I solved my cramping and proved to myself that I can succeed in this sport. So it was my 5th half distance, my 10th triathlon ever and my first victory. Which means I will remember it!

I am presently a mediocre athlete, but I am working hard on improving that and my little glimmer last weekend came in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. If that sounds hot and sticky just to pronounce, you would be right.

In fact, that is the whole reason why I chose the race; since starting on long course triathlon 2 years ago (I was a former runner with a 2.39 marathon PB), I have had huge problems with cramping. Things came to head in a race in early March this year when I cramped barely 45mins into the race. You see, I had got it into my head that cramping was nothing to do with electrolytes and purely down to fitness (something about a report on zapping dead frog legs in a petri dish. Yes I really did believe it), so although I was on point with all aspects of minerals (copper, magnesium, potassium) I totally neglecting sodium. Long story short I started supplementing with sodium and my quality of life and training changed dramatically.

So here we are in the jungle going to do a half Iron distance race, which would be like a long training day. I had one goal, finish the race without being derailed by cramp. Luckily, I made every attempt to sabotage my own goals by the following methods. 1) Go the wrong way out of T1\. Slam on brakes and water bottle flies off losing half of my special salt calorie drink 2) Decide that the best time to reach for salt tabs in my back pocket is on descent at 70kmh and then get angry when they also fly off 3) Repeat step 2 but only this time on a downhill run section.

Despite almost snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, I managed to hold on and win my first ever race, which was my 5th triathlon at this distance and my 10th ever. Look, there's me crossing the finish line first!

But those of you reading this report (hello Mum), will see that it is on Spin Industries. So get to the point about the bike you say. Well I had the fastest bike split, despite my multiple stops to re-attach my nemesis, the waterbottle. Without doubt, the quality of my wheels was a reason for this, and I can give specifics:

The road surface was very poor, concrete mix with multiple pot holes. I was aware of this and because I had DMX fat boys, I was riding a 25mm on 70psi. When chasing down other riders, I was dramatically quicker over the rougher surface than them, despite lowering my wattage during this time. So there you have it, the moral of the story is -- Drew's wheels are so good you can chuck away all of your nutrition on the bike and still win...
