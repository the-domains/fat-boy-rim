An absolutely awesome performance saw Catherine Jameson take 9th place in the elite women's category at the 2016 ITU World Championships.

Catherine has only been racing the Long Course distance since the start of the 2016 season, and with this, her first appearance at a World's final, I can only comment that I'm truly inspired!

Hugest congratulations go to Catherine on a journey that I'm certain is still only just at the very beginning.

You deserve a beer Cat - Doctor's orders!
