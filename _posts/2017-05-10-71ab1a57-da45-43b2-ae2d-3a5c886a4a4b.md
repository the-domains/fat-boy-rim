> Drew,
> Fab wheels! Just spent a week riding these fat boys around the mountains of Gran Canaria shod with Vittoria Corsa g+ tyres 23c. 
> Very responsive up the climbs and extremely stiff. 
> Descending with these wheels gives you masses of confidence, bank them over more than you ever dared before and the grip is amazing. 
> The Ceramic Braking surface combined with the brake blocks provided gives fantastic stopping performance, great modulation also. 
> Last but not least , they look damn "COOL". 
> Thanks Drew!
