What an awesome performance from Catherine, who only decided to race this event at the last minute, filling in time before heading out to the ITU Long Distance World Championships.

It's actually even more awesome when you learn that with a 6am race start on a soggy Sunday morning, that meant Cat had to set the alarm for 3! I'm not even sure I was thinking about leaving the disco at this time ...

Here's how Triathlon England reported on the race.

The 14th edition of The Vitruvian Triathlon on Saturday, organised by Pacesetter Events featured something that is thankfully rare in the history of this race. Rain. The weather seemed to be making up for many previous sunny events however, with the downfall beginning before the swim start and not letting up all day.

It made it a challenging, damp and cold experience for the well over 800 athletes that started from a sold out entry, which was north of 1000\.

The conditions didn't seem to deter Catherine Jameson however. Gaining an advantage of more than two minutes during the two-lap, 1.9km opening swim section, Jameson was never threatened and by the end of the first lap of the rolling bike course, she had built a lead approaching ten minutes. Her day wouldn't be completely incident free however. Setting herself the goal of reaching T2 ahead of the leading men (who started ten minutes behind her), she was on track to achieve that before a mechanical issue left her wrestling with her chain for several minutes in order to complete the course. Using the race as her final preparations before the ITU Long Distance World Championships in Oklahoma, Jameson was steady through the run, eventually crossing the line with a winning margin of 12 minutes.

That's another Vitruvian victory for the Jameson family as Catherine's husband, Joel, is the Men's course record holder.
