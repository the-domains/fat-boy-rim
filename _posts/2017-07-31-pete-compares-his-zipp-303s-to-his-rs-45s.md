> Hi Drew - 
> I'm very pleased! I was holding 30 mph on the flat into a head wind yesterday - they're bloody fantastic! Hugely stiffer than the 303's they replace - you don't realise how flexi Zipp are til you replace them. And all my evidence is empirical, backed up by power.
> I did a local ball ache climb going in and I usually top out at 220 watts climbing and slow down but they held speed well and averaged 196 watts for 12.2 mph for 2 miles. I realise Spanish beef aside I will never be a great climber, but these dividends make a massive difference to mental health being a 'rouleur' style of rider!
