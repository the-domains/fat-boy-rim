> Hi Drew
> I arrived in Belgium and have started to settle down. Still getting used to Europe's (so called) summer finding it a bit chilly. 
> Can't thank you enough for helping me out with getting the wheels. I took them for some rides last week and got to put them to the test in a kermesse last night in Antwerp. A 120km with 17 technical laps. I couldn't find one fault on the wheels. They roll like nothing else I've ever ridden, it feels like I can go even faster around corners and they accelerate out the corners with no effort. And best of all they sound fast which for some reason make me ride faster, don't know if it does but as long as I think it does I think it helps. 
> I rode in the 1.12b category which is for elites and u23s without contracts, basically all the people that haven't yet go a pro contract but are good enough to ride for the pro teams. I was. really happy with how I preformed considering it was my first race in Belgium. 1/4 of the way in I thought I was strong enough to go in a break away, managed to stay in it but once the bunch caught us it was time to suffer at the back for the rest of the race. I managed to stay in contact until the last 2km where my legs blew. I found that it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be but rather the constant sprints out of each corner (204 to be exact) that I need to get used to. my coach was also happy with what I achieved in my first race.
