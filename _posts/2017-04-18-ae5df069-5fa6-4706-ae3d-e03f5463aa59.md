> Hey Drew, I wanted to drop you a line and let you know that my wife and I are really enjoying the wheels you made us. Now it has warmed up here we've been able to get out and give them a real workout. As a matter of fact I thought you might like to see a photo of where they are getting ridden. 
> This view is looking northeast across Utah lake in northern Utah. The large peak to the left of center in the background is Mt. Timpanogos of the Wasatch Mountain range and the one on the right is Provo Peak .(From where the photo is taken Timp is about 20mi away and Provo Peak is about 17mi). As you can see the wheels look great on my bike! My wife loves her Custom Shop orange graphics as well - they're the perfect match for her new bike!
