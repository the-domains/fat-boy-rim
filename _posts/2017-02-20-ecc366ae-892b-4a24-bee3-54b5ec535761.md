# Epic combination!

# Dani Christmas. Koppenberg Fat Boys. Speed Metal Custom titanium bike. Gent Wevelgem 2015\.

Tough girl Dani Christmas in action during the most epic, wet, wild and windy bike race I've ever witnessed - the 2015 edition of Gent Wevelgem.

You'll find Dani pounding her way over berg and cobblestone alike throughout the 2017 Spring Classics season aboard her trusty Speed Metal Custom race bike - now well into its fourth season of hell on the road - along with a selection of carbon and alloy Koppenberg Fat Boys
