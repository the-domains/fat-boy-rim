> Hi Drew
> I'm very pleased - hugely stiffer than the 303's they replace and palpable with the chain so much further down the block towards the 11 with good bike response to torque
> I did a local ball ache climb going in and I usually top out at 220 watts climbing and slow down but they held speed well and averaged 196 watts for 12.2 mph for 2 miles. I realise Spanish beef aside I will never be a great climber, but these dividends make a massive difference to mental health being a 'rouleur' style of rider!
