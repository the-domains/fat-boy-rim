> Loving every minute of riding them drew! 
> I'm actually really surprised at the difference in comfort from the last time I had deep section carbon wheels - I used to have some U.S.E. nano tech 45mm wheels. They always felt really hard and never really settled on them!
> The extra width and lower pressure seems to have massively improved comfort!

> I'm blown away by there quality - every ride is a remind of how nice they are. I was out yesterday morning doing some big climbs and they're just as responsive and comfy climbing as they are descending or cruising! Proper top notch wheels Drew!

## ... always more fun on wheels like these!

## Thanks for riding the DM8 \#FatBoys Tim!
