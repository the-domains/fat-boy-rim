### Awesome performance Simon! Read on to find out how he did it!

> Hi Drew
> Thought you might like to know that I just finished a double header of an Olympic tri one weekend and half Ironman the following. Got a 9th overall and 3rd in Age Group in the Olympic and 2nd overall (non-professionals:)) ...and 1st in Age Group in the Challenge Gran Canaria event.
> Cheers Simon

## Garachico, Tenerife Race Report 11th September 2016

Having had a great summer´s training I was keen to see how this would translate into the triathlon double header I had planned for September. First up was an Olympic distance at Garachico, north Tenerife.

The early morning began with a little disappointment when just as I was all suited and booted in my Zone3 Victory wetsuit ready for a warm up the organisers announced the water temperature was 22 degrees and it would be a non-wetsuit swim. Damn! To be honest the water did feel warm, but as it turned out temperature was the least of my concerns. The northern side of Tenerife is often more turbulent than the south and this day was no exception. The two lap triangular course had us swimming one leg directly into the early rising sun in really choppy and bumpy conditions. I really missed the reassuring buoyancy of my wetsuit, feeling at times that I was more or less vertical in the water:)

Having struggled through the swim I settled down into the bike. I always enjoy this event as it is one of the rare few Olympic events in the Canaries that are non-drafting. I´d focussed my greatest efforts on the bike during the summer and I was pleased to feel strong - I love the deep profile of the Spin carbon wheels - and despite the rolling nature of the course, they had me zipping along at a healthy average of just over 37kph.

There´s always those nagging doubts as you step off the bike about how your legs are going to react, but I was pleased that this was a day when I had my running legs on:) I felt comfortable and strong and managed to run down a couple more people. In the last couple of km I found myself in the "relaxing" position of being too far behind to catch the guy in front and too far ahead to be caught by anyone else. This was great as it meant I was able to grab my two little ones by the hand to celebrate crossing the line in 9th overall and 3rd in my age group. Of course there was the added little bonus that I could save a little energy for the half ironman 6 days later:)

## Challenge Gran Canaria September 17th 2016

This was the second of my September double header - having had a good result in the non-drafting Olympic event the weekend before I was looking forward to seeing how I´d go in the half ironman given more of my efforts during the summer were focussed on this distance.

My race plans were thrown a little when the organisers changed the bike course with less than two weeks to go. The original course looked like it would live up to the event name of "Challenge" - it was a ridiculously hilly course with around 20 up and down peaks adding up to some 1900m! Now I´d be lying if I said there wasnt some relief at seeing a lot more "toned down" bike leg, but this was coupled with a little disappointment. I´d trained (with power) to prepare a race plan for this sort of profile and felt that I´d now be going in a little ¨blind" over what power I could and should be holding for a more rolling course (and consequently the shorter time I´d be on the bike).

Anyway there were two bits of good news for the swim - one - we could wear a wetsuit - yeah - Zone3 Victory wetsuit for me and two - the sea was really calm and inviting (unlike last week). I got a great start in the swim and was comfortable staying at the front of the pack. It was a two lap swim and I got a little separated from two swimmers just ahead, but all in all I had a great swim coming out of the water in 3rd or 4th of the Age Groupers (I didnt realise this at the time as there were swimmers doing a shorter course in the water at the same time).

For the 3 loop bike course given I was holding 285w in training on a hillier (and therefore longer ride) I thought maybe I should aim for about 300w. However, I did fall into the "Superman Trap" - setting off on the first lap I felt great, nay indestructible:) Halfway round and I was averaging just under 320w - hmmmm?! I backed off a little and completed the first lap at 310w. I managed the second lap the same, but I have to hold my hands up and say by the third lap I was feeling it a little. I´d actually ridden myself into 1st position of the Age Groupers and despite seeing my average power drop to 285w for the last lap I retained this lead going into T2\.

Now was where the fun began. And when I say "fun" I mean hellfest of suffering! Blimey if the organisers had let us off the hook by changing to an easy bike course, my God did they pile it back on for the run course! Within 50m of leaving transition I was stumbling up a slope that had my heart rate rocketing about 170bpm just to move. Within 10 minutes of up and down slopes that were probably quicker to walk than run (I tried running from pride rather than efficiency) my legs started to cramp. I just about managed to run this off, but this feeling felt a constant companion throughout the run. As if these vertical walls of pavement werent enough for us to cope with then the 400 or 500m of sand section that we went through 6 times was the final slap in the face! In hindsight I think I did hit the bike too hard, but I´ve never found a run leg so difficult (or miserable):) This wasnt help by seeing the guy in second position reigning me in at every turn point. In the end the lead weight in my legs saw me reeled in and passed around the 18 or 19km mark. I just had no response left, but at least I had 5 or 6 mins on the guy in third!

I´ll be honest and say I was gutted that I couldn´t hold on for what would´ve been my first 1st place finish (I´m ignoring the professionals here:)), but if someone had told me I would have been 2nd overall before going into the event I´d have bitten their arm off and hey ho I still won my own Age Group:))
