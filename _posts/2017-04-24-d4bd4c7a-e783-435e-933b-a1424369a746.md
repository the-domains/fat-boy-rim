> Hi Drew
> How is your weekend going? I will get a proper race report to you asap, which I'll write when I fly home later today. However I just wanted to forward these to you. I did my first race of the season yesterday in Gran Canaria against tough competition. The world champion was here as well as the world duathlon champion amongst other top 10 world champ finishers. I finished 7th in, I would say a "solid" first race. Last year I was too fit too early so the idea was to be strong which I think I was. The course wasn't my sort of race being hilly and a bit technical but it was fun and the wheels were super fast as always. 
> Have a fun Sunday ï˜„ Thank you for everything
