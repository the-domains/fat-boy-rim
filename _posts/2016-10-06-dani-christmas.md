# **INSPIRED**

* October 6, 2016 By: Dani

I have a range of goals and dreams, big and small, that I strive to achieve but most of all I'm extremely competitive, especially with myself. I'm my biggest rival, always trying to be better than 'yesterself'.

Having recently had the pleasure of attending an event with some remarkable people, I left feeling uplifted. It led me to think about the things the have drip fed my motivation over the season and I will carry forward into my winter training.

**Mont Ventoux**  
A bit of history was made on September 3rd. The tour of Ardèche was the first women's race to tackle Mont Ventoux. The monstrous climb is a Tour de France favorite; this year the men whimped out and finished 6km from the summit (something about a stiff breeze at the top) however the stage still made The News At 10 thanks to Froome's Mo Farah impression. The Tour of Ardèche certainly didn't disappoint and lived up to the buzz surrounding the race. I took to the start of stage 3 in the white and green of Lares-Waowdeals as part of the 111 strong peloton all eagerly anticipating (some dreading) the challenge ahead. This challenge was only amplified by temperatures hovering in the mid 30s.

We had a sneak peak of Ventoux looming ominously in the distance during our drive to the start. After a bit of nervous laughter and a few obscenities in the team car I assured my teammates that is was in fact just a cloud formation but no one was falling for it.

When I got my first in-race unobstructed view of the mammoth mountain I was atop another climb, an excited laugh and "oh (insert four letter word)". I resented every metre the road descended at that point, it was another metre we'd have to claw back up.

It's said ignorance is bliss, I 100% agree in this instance. Having never had the opportunity to experience a climb of that nature before (21.8km, averaging 7.4%, finishing at an altitude of 1912m) I could only imagine what it would be like and prepare as best I could for the suffering to come. My training mantra is simple 'suffer, recover, suffer, recover'. Needless to say I'm used to suffering, spending a copious amount of time in 'the box', 'the pain cave' whatever you want to call it. Ventoux, for me was different. Having established the early break, then battled the unforgiving headwind solo in to the base mountain I was nearing my limit as I hit the foot slopes. My morale was lifted in every village passed with the locals out to offer their shouts of "Allez, Allez, Allez" and a few extra much needed bottles of water to chuck over myself (possibility the only advantage of being solo). When the lead group, containing our team leader and eventual GC winner, Flavia Oliveira, did eventually catch me with 15km go I was ready to help but well aware this wasn't going to last long. When the inevitable happened and my day was done it was just a case of rolling in. Yeah, rolling in on a mountain doesn't really happen. Under normal circumstances when the gradient relinquishes your legs a granted permission to spin again, the gradient didn't relinquish. I think I will forever remember looking up and seeing the 11km to go sign, looking down and seeing our current speed was 8km/h. "Oh (insert another four letter word)" Ventoux was a bloody hard day, but an incredible experience, being in the break the tackling the legendary climb. I can't wait to go back for more.

**Racing on Home Roads**  
I was always jealous of the guys I lived with having races close to home, three times this year I was able to shove a backpack on and ride out to a race, however having the Lotto Belgium Tour coming with a few kms of my Belgian base on stage 3 and 4 was super special. My week leading into the Lotto Belgium Tour went like this -- Travel to southern France, race first 4 days of the brutal Tour of Ardèche -- day 1 was flat, you know about the stage 3, stages 2 & 4 were just as 'lumpy', 14 hour travel day home, start Belgium Tour. Despite feeling like a buckled zombie off the bike my legs were still good for the road stages, when the circus came onto my home roads it felt extra special. I felt like I was floating up the climbs, so much so when I gapped the peloton I decided to just go for it, it was the final stage after all (my 8th stage in 9 days). Taking the famous Muur climb solo was my second goosebumps moment in a week, this time the crowds that lined the climb were shouting at me in English, testament to Belgian fans knowing I'd appreciate encouragement in my mother tongue. I've raced up the Muur 6 times, all previous painful memories now come with a rose-tinted sheen.

**Family**  
"I didn't know what was going on, but it was really cool to watch." The honest assessment of my sister's first bike race. Having grown up with my sister competing alongside me as a runner I was used to having her races. Since relocating to Asia, she's heard all about my transition to cycling but hasn't witnessed it. A flying visit to Belgium this summer provided the perfect opportunity. There was no way I wasn't coming away with the big 'W'. Unfortunately we didn't have chicken for dinner but I did stand on the top step of the podium.

**Coached Athletes**  
I have the pleasure of working with a great bunch of athletes helping them achieve their sporting goals. My job as a coach is not just make them go faster but to make them go better. It's different. Helping them become better constantly reinforces the small daily habits that will make me the best version of myself. That's what I strive for, to be the best me. So thanks guys for inadvertently reminding me of that.

**Rio**  
I think it's humanly impossible not to be inspired in some way by the greatest show on earth. For me watching friends, former training partners and housemates fulfill lifelong dreams of becoming Olympians was truly incredible. It makes it all the more special when you have shared a small part of that journey with them, knowing you're not the only one with an unnecessary amount of setbacks but seeing the elation when it all comes good.

My one take away message from Rio: never give up!
