What I&apos;m really surprised about is the difference in comfort from the last time I had [famous name] deep section carbon wheels and they always felt really hard and never really settled on them!

I&apos;m blown away by their quality - every ride is a reminder of how nice they are. </blockquote>,<h2>‚Ä¶ always more fun on wheels like these!</h2>,<h2>Thanks for riding the DM8 #FatBoys Tim!</h2>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Hey! #FatBoy!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hey! #FatBoy!</h1>,<h1>Whether you're a flyweight climber, powerful puncheur, Strava segment shredder or Red Hook racer, you'll spin so much faster on these Fat Boy Rims</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adac849e-4fb5-44cd-9e24-8bad145d13ac.jpg" title="The DM8 #FatBoys">,<a href="http://ridefullgas.com/dm8" data-role="cta">See The Range</a>,<p>I‚Äôve engineered the Koppenberg DM8 Super Fat Boys to be aero, light, stiff, robust, and durable. You know, all that stuff that every high-performance wheel brand lays claim to - some more <em>truthfully</em>, and many more <em>optimistically </em>than others.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ac32ca9d-a758-431a-bfd4-98b95200dcc6.jpg" title="Custom build with re-issued F-Ltd spoke pattern">,<p>But for the DM8 series rim profiles, all of that was simply not enough. After all, I already had my most successful and well established DMX range of wheels chugging along nicely thanks, and the DMX wheels ticked all those boxes loud and clear.</p>,<p>So with DM8 what I wanted was to go way beyond DMX, and at least one stage further than any other maker has yet considered for their premium performance road wheels.</p>,<p>In my view, it‚Äôs simply not enough to be <em>just </em>aero, light and stiff. Most of the really top-end, big bucks wheels get this just about right - more or less. But if you want to go really fast out there in the real world, consistently fast and always in supreme comfort and sure-footed safety, your tyres are in fact the key.</p>,<p>More specifically, matching the rim to the tyre width to achieve the optimal performance window of the tyre. So my focus with DM8 was on <em>optimising </em>ride performance with <strong>25mm </strong>(and upto 28mm) tyres. Because those are what every roadie and racer rides these days - even if they don‚Äôt yet know it!</p>,<p>It‚Äôs for this specific reason that the DM8s are so wide. Wider internally in fact than any wheel currently offered by Zipp, Enve, Reynolds, Easton, Mavic, Fulcrum, FFWD, Campagnolo, Shimano, or to my knowledge, any other purveyor of fast wheels.</p>,<p>Sometimes I think that many of these otherwise fine wheels have their gimmicks tagged on by the marketing department - dimples, spoilers, stick-on fairings, extra-loud stickers, sharks tooth inner radii. I have my fun with this part of the game too, so this is not a complaint from me. But the thing that none of these ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù address is perhaps the most important of all: the question of optimising the size of tyre everyone is riding these days. And the fact is, on anything skinnier than a DM8 rim, those 25mm tyres cannot attain their optimal shape.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f6f82306-b5b0-4cff-aeed-4f7539578756.jpg" title="DM8 track build - light &amp; quick for your #RedHookCrit">,<p>My goal with DM8 was perfect tread profiles with 25mm tyres - tyres that arc smoothly from one edge of the rim to the other, without any need for high pressures nor bulging sidewalls. Because what this means to you, out on your bike is <em><strong>more</strong></em>! <em>More </em>speed, <em>more </em>grip, <em>more </em>comfort, and <em>more </em>safety. And all of this with <em>less </em>effort.</p>,<h2>Get more from your wheels!</h2>,<h2>More Speed. More Grip. More Comfort. More Control. More wheel!</h2>,<blockquote>Demand more - spend less! Less cash. Less effort. More wheel!</blockquote>,<p>DM8s are upto 30mm at their widest, yet will fit most modern road, race, track, gravel and CX bikes. You can find out how by clicking the read on link below!</p>,<blockquote>DM8 rims are wider than most rims are deep!</blockquote>,<p>Choose from two build variations for the <strong>road</strong>, centre lock <strong>disc </strong>with <strong>thru-axles</strong> for <strong>road/gravel/CX</strong>, or fixed/fixed <strong>track</strong> hubs to go race those Red Hook Crits. Combine with three rim depths and the DM8s range from <strong>1470 grams</strong> and <strong>¬£990 / pair</strong>.</p>,<p>I make each and every wheel entirely by hand, and customise the build precisely - for you and the way you ride. They‚Äôre the best wheels I‚Äôve ever made. And I‚Äôm confident that they‚Äôre the best wheels you‚Äôll have ridden - ever!</p>,<p>Please read on to find out how DM8 came about, and why these very fast #FatBoys entirely outperform and supersede my previous best-selling DMX range of wheels.</p>]]></description>
