  Hey Drew!


  Just thought I'd let you know that I recently completed the 7-day Ride the
  Rockies (http://www.ridetherockies.com/) here in the states. 470 miles and
  30,000 ft of climbing. Here's a couple of photos, one after completing the
  final climb of the tour over Monarch Pass at 11,312 feet and of part of our
  World Bicycle Relief Team crossing the finish line in Salida, CO. Whether
  beating out the headwinds on the flats, climbing the peaks, or descending at
  50+ mph down the mountain passes, the wheels were awesome in every way!


  Have a great summer!

  Bob
