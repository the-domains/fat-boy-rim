title: "| C R I T L E A N | Had an awesome time racing at my hometown race aka the @waterkantkrit Hamburg this weekend. First some track racing on Friday which was super fun, then the pasta party with trackgames and finally on Saturday evening the krit itself. Legs felt not too good and I got dropped by the first group after 8 or so laps. Managed to fight for another 8 rounds together with the two fellas on the picture. Say hello to the pain train \uD83D\uDE89! Can't wait for the next race in Hanover next weekend! Thx @schtinar for the #topnice picture and @filipshleir for the awesome race weekend ❤️ #critlife #critlean #paintrain #teamcatchy #suicycle #specializedde #ballernballern #thestreetistdiestraße #eelisreal #hagenwechsel #spinonthese #axlightness #benobikesberlin #specializedracing #sbceventteam #fixedgear #fixie #racelife #maschine"
