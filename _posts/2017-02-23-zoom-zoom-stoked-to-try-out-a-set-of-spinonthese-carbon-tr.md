  Zoom Zoom! Stoked to try out a set of @spinonthese Carbon track clinchers, the
  Fat Boy DM8s. Hand built in the UK, these have wide footprint for increased
  grip and stability. I'm running them with tubes and @wildernesstrailbikes
  Freedom's Thickslick tyres for now, but as they're tubeless compatible too I'm
  gonna switch them up later and try 'em tubeless too. #vansgirls #spinonthese
