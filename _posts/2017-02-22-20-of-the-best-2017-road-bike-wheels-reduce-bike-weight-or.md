  One of the most popular upgrades, better wheels ( and tyres) can dramatically
  improve your bike's ride. Stock wheels are often heavy and of mediocre quality
  - upgrading can reduce weight and improve reliability. If you want to go
  faster, choose wheels with deep-section rims; aerodynamics is far more
  important than weight.
