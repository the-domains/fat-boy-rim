Hello Drew   
Pinging over a hello as long time no speak. Just wanted to catch up. Hope business is good and Spin wheels are flying out.

This morning 7am start just did Exminster to Barnstaple in 2 hour 9 mins. Average speed 75% quartile as per power meter data 21.9 mph ~ a 44 miler on rolling roads with the 58mm shod on my Cervelo R5\.

As always, utterly brilliant wheels. Flawless. These wheels, man, they make me feel brilliant and are just on another level. Bloody brilliant.

I've never ridden wheels like it and in recent past lets says last ten years I wasted money on 303/404/808 et al and other brands including Fast Forward, Mavic and co. As you once said 10% goes into the wheels, the rest is VAT and marketing. 

Hope this email finds you well !!!
